This is KDE Plasma with the Arch Linux. Arch Linux is a minimalist distribution, you need to go from a command prompt to the desktop.

Why don't I use a WM? Personal choice to use KDE because I am just to use to going to find a System Setting and changing things from there. In the futrue I am planning on using a WM such as [AwesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) or [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/). These two caught my eye because they are both dynamic window managers.

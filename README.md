This is KDE Plasma with the Artix Linux. Artix Linux is a distrubution that is Arch based, but with a different init system. I am using the OpenRC init system for my build.

Why don't I use a WM? Personal choice to use KDE because I am just to use to going to find a System Setting and changing things from there. In the futrue I am planning on using a WM such as [AwesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) or [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/). Theese two caught my eye because they are both dynamic window managers.
